## Hello everybody ðŸŽ‰
This space was created as a binder for several dedicated unofficial repos for "Nodejs & MongoDb bilerplates and exemple project".<br>
Everything you see is legacy, unofficial material built for business purposes

---

- <b>Remember:</b> This space is not an official github or nodejs/MongoDb space.
- <b>How to:</b> Browse [all repositories](https://github.com/orgs/js-node-collection/repositories?q=&sort=name) and discover every detail of them. You can see it? So, It's GNU! ;)
- <b>Licence:</b> All licenses are present within each repository. We don't assume any responsibility for the material displayed. 
- <b>Contribute:</b> No plans are currently open or ready to contribute ... however you can always send a message to a contributor.
